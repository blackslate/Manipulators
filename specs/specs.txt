Finding the closest point on a translation axis to a given ray can lead to un-intuitive results if the translation axis is almost parallel to the camera. Moving the mouse ray right may move the closest point on the translation axis to the left.

An alternative solution is to create a plane that contains the translation axis and whose normal is from the closest point on the translation axis towards the camera. Such a plane needs to be created for only the object that the user clicked on. All other selected objects will move in the same fashion.

STEPS 

On startDrag:
  Find closest point on translation axis to camera position
  Create normal from that point to the camera
  Determine how for the plane is from the origin along this normal

On drag:
  Create mouse ray
  Determine where mouse ray cuts the orthogonal plane
  Find closest point on translation axis to this intersection point
